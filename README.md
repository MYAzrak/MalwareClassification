# Malware Classification
DT, Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, and KNN on the MalMem-2022 dataset for obfuscated malware classification.

# Dataset
The [MalMem2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/malware-detection-from-memory-dump) dataset contains features describing obfuscated malware memory dumps. [Published in 2022](https://www.scitepress.org/Link.aspx?doi=10.5220/0010908200003120), the dataset uses real world obfuscated malware and contains around 60,000 observations, and 55 features. The features are engineered to capture useful information to distinguish between normal software and hidden malware. In this project, we focus on two types of classification: binary and ternary. Binary classification aims to distinguish between benign and malware observations, and ternary classification aims to distinguish between the malware types (Spyware, Trojan and Ransomware).
The features of the dataset are collected using various memory dump programs and contain data about many low-level characteristics of the program. The programs are run in debug mode to collect the memory information and give an accurate representation of typical software processes during a malware attack. These low-level characteristics include events, services, semaphores, callbacks and more. The features were engineered to provide a somewhat distinct decision boundary between malware and benign classes.
The observation distribution is very balanced, containing approximately 50% benign, and 50% malware with the subtypes of malware also equally distributed at 33% within malware. The exact counts for Benign, Spyware, Ransomware and Trojan are 29298, 10020, 9791 and 9487 respectively.


## Our conclusion
Our project has focused on developing a model for detecting malware and identifying malware types. The binary (benign/malware) classification type showed very high testing accuracy, similar to the literature, at 0.999 with any model used. Although this high accuracy does not seem realistic, it is a result of the feature engineering carried out in the dataset that creates a very clear decision boundary. As shown in table below, the ternary (spyware/ransomeware/tojran) classification type also performed well with the best testing accuracy of 0.874 with recall, precision and F-score of 0.865, 0.874 and 0.869 respectively. Compared to the literature, our model performs on par with the best accuracy. Our methods could be further improved with a more thorough hyper parameter search, feature selection and the use of ensemble methods to reduce variance of the overall model.
